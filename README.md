Mapty App - Built with Javascript <br>

Student project created as part of the Modern JavaScript Bootcamp by Jonas Schedtmann, accessible via the online business-school Udemy.com <br>

Independently developed functionalities:

- Ability to <b>delete</b> a workout (Working on it!!!)
- Ability to <b>delete all</b> workouts (Done!!!)

Future functionalities: <br>

- Ability to <b>edit</b> a workout

- <b>Display weather data</b> for workout time and place [ASYNC JS]
